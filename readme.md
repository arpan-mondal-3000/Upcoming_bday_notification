# Upcoming Birthday Notification

## Idea

If you tend to forget your friend's or any other person's birthdays which you need to remember then you are at the right place. It is a script which can notify you the day before the bithday of the person you want to remember.

## How to setup

Dowload the repo and install all the pip packages required, i.e., winotify and sqlite3. Then create an sqlite3 database named 'userdata.db' and create three columns, i.e., id, name and dob. Make sure to check all the spellings. Then add the required data. Then add the script to your windows task scheduler and you are good to go.
